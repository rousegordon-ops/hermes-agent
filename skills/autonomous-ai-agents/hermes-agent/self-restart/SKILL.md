# self-restart

Trigger a Railway redeploy of the hermes-agent service. The container exits and a new one starts; the entrypoint refreshes `/opt/data/repo` and re-symlinks workspace skills, and daemons + gateway pick up the new code.

**Observed duration (2026-05-15):** ~8 minutes BUILDING + ~1 minute DEPLOYING ≈ ~10 minutes total. Despite the `serviceInstanceRedeploy` mutation name, Railway appears to perform a full rebuild from `release-pin`, not a fast same-image restart. Either Railway changed behavior or earlier-documented "~30s same-image" claim was always wrong. **Treat as rebuild-class for planning** until proven otherwise: pre-warn the user of ~10 min downtime, don't chain rapid restarts.

## When to Invoke

- You just edited a **Bucket-2** file: `tools/**`, `gateway/**`, `scripts/source_watcher.py`, `scripts/cost_report_daemon.py`, top-level `*.py` (anything imported into the long-running gateway or long-running daemon scripts).
- AND you want the change live (not just persisted to git).
- AND it is **not** a rebuild-class change (not a Bucket-3 file: no Dockerfile, docker/**, pyproject.toml, package*.json, requirements*.txt, uv.lock).

**Bucket quick-ref:**
- Bucket 1 (no action): `skills/**`, `*.md`, `docs/**`, `scripts/cost_report.py`
- Bucket 2 (self-restart): `tools/**`, `gateway/**`, `scripts/source_watcher.py`, `scripts/cost_report_daemon.py`, top-level `*.py`
- Bucket 3 (self-rebuild): `Dockerfile`, `docker/**`, `pyproject.toml`, `package*.json`, `requirements*.txt`, `uv.lock`

## Action

POST the `serviceInstanceRedeploy` mutation to Railway's GraphQL API.

**Caution:** The gateway process exits when the container is told to redeploy — the current conversation will be cut short mid-reply. **Tell the user "Restarting now — the new container will be ready in ~10 minutes (full rebuild)" before triggering.** The resumption signal is now gateway-owned: if `.restart_notify.json` exists, `gateway/run.py:_send_restart_notification()` sends `I'm back!` after adapters reconnect, then removes the flag.

Pending uncommitted edits in `/opt/data/repo` survive the restart (entrypoint preserves them); the watcher commits them on next boot. You can trigger restart immediately after editing without waiting for the watcher.

User confirmation **IS** required — restart is rebuild-class. It is no longer a "cheap" operation worth taking unilaterally. Do not quote dollar cost or build-minute estimates to Gordon unless he explicitly asks.

## Implementation

Use `curl` (matches GordonClaw's `gordonclaw-self-restart` skill — same recipe, same failure modes, shared notes). The `User-Agent` header is mandatory: Cloudflare's WAF blocks default UAs (Python urllib, etc.) with 403 before the request reaches Railway.

**Write the planned-redeploy marker first.** The gateway's SIGTERM handler reads this marker and exits 0 instead of 1, so Railway doesn't fire a spurious "Deploy Crashed!" notification when it tears down the container for the redeploy.

```bash
HERMES_HOME="${HERMES_HOME:-/opt/data}"
touch "$HERMES_HOME/.planned_redeploy"

curl -s -X POST https://backboard.railway.app/graphql/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RAILWAY_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: railway-cli/4.44.0" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { serviceInstanceRedeploy(serviceId: \"c32be0a9-9d43-49a8-bf43-764915360dfb\", environmentId: \"38eea0f3-0bd3-48f4-abaf-ec3de09174de\") }"
  }'
```

The IDs are baked in (not secrets):
- Project: `pretty-amazement` (`c49b3e8b-a36d-4d24-a972-eab5e05b881d`)
- Service: `c32be0a9-9d43-49a8-bf43-764915360dfb`
- Environment (production): `38eea0f3-0bd3-48f4-abaf-ec3de09174de`

`RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` is set as a service env var in Railway. If unset, the curl will fail with a 401; tell the user the token isn't configured and stop.

### Programmatic restarts and the "I'm back!" flag file

`gateway/run.py:_send_restart_notification()` sends `I'm back!` only when `.restart_notify.json` exists. Chat `/restart` writes this file automatically. For a programmatic Railway redeploy, pre-create the flag *before* curl:

```bash
HERMES_HOME="${HERMES_HOME:-/opt/data}"
printf '{"platform":"telegram","chat_id":"%s"}' "$TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL" \
  > "$HERMES_HOME/.restart_notify.json"
```

On the next gateway startup, after adapters reconnect, the gateway sends `I'm back!` to that target and removes the flag. Do not rely on the Docker entrypoint for this signal.

**Duplicate notification pitfall:** there must be exactly one startup comeback sender. Gordon's Railway fork previously had an unconditional sender in `docker/entrypoint.sh` plus the gateway flag-file sender, which produced two `I'm back!` messages. The desired source is the gateway flag-file path only: it is conditional on a user-requested restart/redeploy and uses the connected adapter. If duplicate `I'm back!` messages appear, search both `gateway/run.py` and `docker/entrypoint.sh` for `I'm back`/`sendMessage` and remove the unconditional entrypoint sender. Changes under `docker/**` are Bucket 3 and need a rebuild/image refresh, not just a same-container code restart.

## Known Failure Modes

### Mode A — HTTP 403 from Cloudflare (code 1010 "Access denied")
Almost always the User-Agent header is missing or set to a default urllib/python UA. Cloudflare blocks before the token is checked. Verify the request includes `User-Agent: railway-cli/4.44.0` (or any non-default UA).

If introspection ALSO 403s, it's a real auth problem — generate a new account-level token at https://railway.app/account with `read` + `write` scopes.

### Mode B — "Cannot query field"
The mutation name was renamed (e.g. `serviceInstanceRedeploy` → `deploymentRedeploy`). Introspect to find the current name:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://backboard.railway.app/graphql/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RAILWAY_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: railway-cli/4.44.0" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __schema { mutationType { fields { name } } } }"}' \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('\n'.join(f['name'] for f in d['data']['__schema']['mutationType']['fields'] if 'edeploy' in f['name'].lower() or 'estart' in f['name'].lower()))"
```

Update this skill with the new mutation name.

### Mode C — "Not Authorized" (INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
HTTP 200 with `{"errors":[{"message":"Not Authorized","extensions":{"code":"INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"}}]}`. Three sub-causes:

- **C1 — Wrong project token**: token belongs to a different Railway project. Get a token from the **correct** project's Settings → API Tokens.
- **C2 — Account not a project member**: invite the token's account to **Settings → Members** as Admin or Developer (not Viewer); accept the invite fully (no "pending").
- **C3 — Token missing scopes**: regenerate at https://railway.app/account with `read` + `write`.

Note: Railway injects env vars at container **startup**, not dynamically. Updating `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` in the dashboard while the container is running has NO effect — must trigger a manual redeploy from the dashboard so the new token takes effect.

## Required env

- `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` — workspace-scoped Railway API token, set as a service env var in Railway dashboard. NOT a GitHub secret.
- `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL` — only required if you want the chat-side "I'm back!" notification (the flag-file trick above).

## What never to do

- Never use the `railway` CLI from the container — the CLI requires a login flow we haven't set up. Use the GraphQL API directly via curl.
- Never call this skill without telling the user first. Restart cuts off any in-flight conversation.
- Never call this skill for Bucket 1 changes (skills, brief scripts, docs). They're already live; a restart is wasted.
- Never strip the `User-Agent` header thinking it's optional. It isn't.

## Cross-reference

GordonClaw uses the identical recipe in its `gordonclaw-self-restart` skill (different project/service/environment IDs and token, same curl invocation). Keep the two skills in lockstep — when you fix or extend one, mirror the change to the other.

## Verification

Print the raw API response verbatim. Tell the user clearly: **"Restarting now — the new container will be ready in ~10 minutes (full rebuild from release-pin)."** Do not promise ~30s; the observed behavior is rebuild-class.
